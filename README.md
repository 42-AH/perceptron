# Perceptron in Go
I just learned Go, and I wanted to make something, so I decided a perceptron sounded fun. Now keep in mind, this one is super simple and more complex ones will be coming out. Also compared to Python, go is sooooo fast, so I think I will stick with it. Use without credit, as anyone could make this if they wanted to.
